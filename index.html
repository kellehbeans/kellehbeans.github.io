        <h2>About Kelly
        </h2>
		
		<div class="long">
        <p>
            I am Kelly! If you were wondering why my tagline is 'Joe made me do it', it is because one of my best friends went on at me for months on end to buy this domain because it was 'just so awesome'.
            I eventually bought it and the first page I ever created purely just said that. That, and he did make me do it. Then, he went on to make me creating an e-mail that was just 'hi'. Again, I ended
            up doing this.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a .NET developer, specialising in SharePoint; I am a tomboy, but I have a rather large collection of high-heeled shoes, a large amount of clothing, which I generally end up selling
            on eBay and getting even more; I cannot sit still for more than two minutes and have to keep myself entertained, whether this be developing something, going for a walk, making a meal or going
            out to socialise; I have a fear of seaweed, fish and bugs touching me; I am trying to be more out-going by getting myself out into the world, visiting places and seeing all kinds of weird things;
            I absolutely love cars - I can listen to Volkswagen engines and tell you what engine is running without even looking at the car (sad or just genius?). I currently own a Red Honda Civic Type S which
            is a major upgrade in brake horse power against my 55BHP Volkswagen Polo; I love to volunteer with young people and I am known to be a good listener when somebody does need an ear.<br />
            I generally do not take life seriously all the time, but I do know when I need to behave. I am extremely laidback and I am not very easily offended - in fact, I cannot remember the last time 
            somebody offended me! I try to get on with absolutely anybody and I am known to talk to anyone - although most of my most indepth conversations occur at bus stops or in toilets which involves 
            talking about shoes!
            <br />
            Lastly, the most important fact about me is that I am absolute tea and Diet Coke fiend. Feed me tea and I will not turn into a monster! However, I am quite partial to a cup of coffee and those are highly
            appreciated on a Monday morning.
        </p>
        <p>
            More information about myself are shown below in more detail.

        <h2>About Work</h2>
		<div class="long">
        <p>
            I work for a company called Westcoast Limited, which is a company that sells and distributes computing peripherals. I work in the IT department which is relatively small, containing around 25 people.
            I have been here since I was 18, starting back in June 2011. I work on the Data Team, which involves using SQL and Reporting services. However, personally I deal with SharePoint - I am known as 
            the 'SharePoint Guru'!
        </p>
        <p>
            I started out as a .NET Software Developer Apprentice with an apprenticeship company called QA who placed me at Westcoast - and I have been here ever since! I was phoned with this opportunity -
            but the interview was less than 24 hours time after this call! From this apprenticeship, I gained City & Guilds qualifications and A*-C A-levels, and of course, a lot of work experience. I
            also gained a lot of independence as I was away from home for a period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I now look after the Company's Intranet - generally maintaining it, developing applications and just generally being the 'fountain of knowledge'! We are currently running SharePoint 2013, but when I
            started the company, I was given SharePoint 2010 to play with, where I *slowly* learned how annoying the out-of-the-box stylesheets were, found bugs and work
            arounds in the software (and then wrote about the solution if information was sparse or non-existent on the Web) and just in general got to grips with how it all worked so I could relay this
            information back to others.
        </p>
        <p>
            The applications that I write are all done in Visual Studio using C# on a development server, specifically tailored for SharePoint Foundations. I have created many different applications for internal usage,
            using SharePoint in some to store data; SQL in others. I have previously set up a large set of SharePoint list libraries to store different files for our Sales team to store different files, 
            such as price lists, with a search application to help them find the file quickly when on the phone to customers. Other applications have included forms to request different equipment from our
            department; a tracker to see who has logged into a specific page on the Intranet to create reports; a training portal to keep track of training sessions and their attendees and so many more
            just to help make jobs easier within the company.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<div class="long">
        <p>
            I am a tomboy. There is no avoiding it and the only real label I can stick to myself. I enjoy track racing of all kinds, especially truck racing; I watch football and support Reading FC; I
            like photography; I love exercise - especially Zumba; I like cooking and baking; I game, and here it the girliest of all - I love to shop when I have no reason to shop (although give me a 
            reason to shop and I will throw a tantrum). 
        </p>
        <p>
            I attend many different race meets, mainly with the British Truck Racing Association (BTRA). The tracks I usually go to are Pembrey Circuit; Brands Hatch and Thruxton. I love anything with an engine
            in general, so I can usually be found at airshows, race events and Army shows. This is probably my all-time favourite hobby as it strangely relaxes me! Cars (alongside computers) are probably 
            one of my biggest interests. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With photography, I tend to try and get the 'perfect' action-shot from one of the race meets that I attend, but I also have an interest in landscapes and nature. My favourite type of place to
            take photos is probably at a zoo. I currently own a Sony Alpha A33 which is a SLT camera, with a 18-55mm lens and also a 75-300mm lens. I am hoping to expand my collection of lenses very soon! 
            I currently do not store my photographs on the Internet because I am very fussy as to what I upload for the world to see - especially when there are people that are a hundred times better
            than I feel I am! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Gaming and computers is probably one of the most notable hobbies I have. I have been using a computer since the age of 4, where it enabled me to get to a higher level of reading skills
            as a child. I have volunteered at my own school to help younger year groups in their IT classes, which allowed me to help them with Scratch and Microsoft products.
            <br />
            I do not play one particular type of game as I am broad-minded when it comes to games. I play are games such as Guild Wars, Pokemon, Heavy Rain, Watchdogs and so many more. I own far 
            too many consoles to even list them here. I am a complete and utter gadget hoarder - even if I know that I do not need those gadgets! I would much rather buy a useless gadget that I do not need
            over a pair of shoes - which makes me stand out. Saying that, I have a large collection of high-heeled shoes (have I mentioned this before?)!
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, my baking and cooking is probably much to be desired - in presentation form at least. I enjoy it, and that's the main thing, right? I make things and usually feed them to 
            unexpecting people. I did start a personal recipe blog, but it has soon been lost in the jungle that is the Internet.

    <section id="achievements">
        <h2>Achievements</h2>
		<div class="long">
        <p>I cannot claim I have had some many achievements over my short life, but most of the achievements I do have are probably a little more personal than worthwhile to anybody else.</p>
        <p>
            My first achievement that I will talk about is attending a 'Big Ambition' event which was held at Microsoft in Reading, when I was about 16. The aim of the event was to get girls into the
            IT industry. There were selected girls from different local schools and we were given the task to design a product. Most groups decided to create a mirror where you could instantly
            photoshop yourself to see how you would look in a particular outfit, with a certain hairstyle or wearing specific make-up. Our group came up with wireless earphones, which I can proudly
            say was my idea as my group was swaying to the idea that other groups that had come up with.
        </p>
        <p>
            The design was simple - it was just like normal earbuds that you inserted into your ear, using bluetooth technology which would connect to your phone. We had to do a lot of diagrams and
            other sorts of documentation as if we were truly designing this product. At the end, we also had to present it to the other girls in the other schools. Needless to say, we won. We all obtained
            an iPod shuffle in a range of colours. One of the Microsoft staff members did help out in our group and said that he was going to keep me in his cupboard to come up with all of his design
            work! But the one thing I will never forget will be the Robbie Williams cardboard cut-out that looked down at us through a window.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other achievements include getting invovled with a Boys Brigade company in Wallingford, which is approximately 12 miles away from where I live. I travel there every Wednesday and I generally
            deal with the Seniors which are from 13-17 years of age. We do different activities such as cooking, health and fitness and so many more. We also do an annual camp where we get to do
            lots of fun activities such as swimming, ghost walks, Go Ape, team games and visiting different towns around the area. I find it helps a lot of the children to find their own independence
            and make a lot of new friends outside of school. I have volunteered to take charge of the activities for the next camp where I will be booking different places to visit and finding lots of
            different things for the children to enjoy their summer holiday.
        </p>
        <p>
            A more personal achievement is losing weight and getting my health and fitness to the best it has been. I used to absolutely hate physical education and school and have always been rather lazy. 
            Now I enjoy going to Zumba which I do twice a week, running, cycling, lots of walking and I am now looking in to doing kayaking - which is a massive step for me because I dislike fresh water 
            (I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat!).
