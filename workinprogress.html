        <h2>About Kelly
        </h2>
        <p>I am Kelly! I am a .NET developer, specialising in SharePoint. </p>

        <h2>About Work</h2>
        <p>
            I work for a company called Westcoast Limited, which is a company that sells and distributes computing peripherals. I work in the IT department which is relatively small, containing around 25 people.
            I have been here since I was 18, starting back in June 2011. I work on the Data Team, which involves using SQL and Reporting services. However, personally I deal with SharePoint - I am known as 
            the 'SharePoint Guru'!
        </p>
        <p>
            I started out as a .NET Software Developer Apprentice with an apprenticeship company called QA who placed me at Westcoast - and I have been here ever since! I was phoned with this opportunity -
            but the interview was less than 24 hours time after this call! From this apprenticeship, I gained City & Guilds qualifications and A*-C A-levels, and of course, a lot of work experience. I
            also gained a lot of independence as I was away from home for a period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I now look after the Company's Intranet - generally maintaining it, developing applications and just generally being the 'fountain of knowledge'! We are currently running SharePoint 2013, but when I
            started the company, I was given SharePoint 2010 to play with, where I *slowly* learned how annoying the out-of-the-box stylesheets were, found bugs and work
            arounds in the software (and then wrote about the solution if information was sparse or non-existent on the Web) and just in general got to grips with how it all worked so I could relay this
            information back to others.
        </p>
        <p>
            The applications that I write are all done in Visual Studio using C# on a development server, specifically tailored for SharePoint Foundations. I have created many different applications for internal usage,
            using SharePoint in some to store data; SQL in others. I have previously set up a large set of SharePoint list libraries to store different files for our Sales team to store different files, 
            such as price lists, with a search application to help them find the file quickly when on the phone to customers. Other applications have included forms to request different equipment from our
            department; a tracker to see who has logged into a specific page on the Intranet to create reports; a training portal to keep track of training sessions and their attendees and so many more
            just to help make jobs easier within the company.
